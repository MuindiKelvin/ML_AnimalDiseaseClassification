This project aims to design and implement machine learning algorithms to classify general animal diseases and deploy the developed models in an interface. 

The first objective was to identify the most suitable machine-learning algorithm for disease classification from integrated health records. After a detailed review of all the examined models, it was decided to choose the Random Forest model because of its high accuracy and reliability. 

This model was successfully integrated into the application interface layer where the users can engage and obtain forecasts in a real-time manner. It also explores advanced preprocessing techniques which formed an important input during feature optimization and when enhancing the modelâ€™s performance. 

Also, the project outcome implies that integrating the machine learning models that include the Random Forest model into the diagnostic framework of veterinary medicine can augment the improved classification of ailments to expedite diagnosis and improve animal health care. 

Therefore, this project occupies a place in the progressive branch of veterinary data science and offers a practical perspective for improving diagnostics in veterinary medicine.

Note: The project was developed using a dataset collected from Kaggle.com. Concrete predictions can be generated if the project models could be trained on a more realistic dataset.
